<h3><em>Have you considered visiting London, England for your next trip? If yes, then you came in the right place! </em></h3>

<h2> Here are the top 5 must visit places in London.</h2>

<h4>1. London eye</h4>
<img src=" https://www.britainexpress.com/images/attractions/editor3/London-Eye-0367.jpg" height="300"width="550";>
<p>London Eye,is one of the famous landmarks in the UK. This Millenium Wheel is also one of the reasons why London Skyline is is the best at night. If you would like to see the 360° views of the City, this will be the best bet.</p>

<h4> 2. Buckingham Palace</h4>

<p> The Buckingham Palace, located in the city of Westminster. is the home of Queen Elizabeth II. We will often see Royal Guards around this area.</p>

<h4> 3. Tower Bridge </h4>
<img src=" https://www.parkgrandkensington.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/236496559.jpg" height="300"width="550";>
<p> THIS IS NOT THE LONDON BRIDGE! People often call it by the wrong name, but this is called the Tower Bridge. This is the iconic London's landmark and visitors or tourist will always have a picture in this location, so don't miss it!</p>

<h4> 4. Westminster Abbey</h4>
<img src="https://heyexplorer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/westminster-abbey.jpeg" height="300"width="550";>
<p> Westminster Abbey, "A Royal Church", is the site of ceremonies. This is where 17 Royal Weddings had taken place.</p>

<h4> 5. Big Ben </h4>
<img src="https://heyexplorer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/big-ben-london.jpeg" height="300"width="550";>
<p> Big Ben is the Great Big Bell in London. Unfortunately, Big Ben is under construction since 2017, so you won't be able to see it since it is covered with scaffolding during this time. Hopefully the construction will be done by 2022.
